# A-study-on-the-performance-of-non-performing-loans-and-interest-rates

This project contains the following: 

- A R markdown file displaying my statistical work and the content of the essay
- A pdf that was knitted from the previous R markdown file. This acts as the essay itself
- The dataset called loan-performance that was analysed from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
